							<h2>Thanks for Dropping By</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Welcome - this is where I occasionally post some of my work.  I'm passionate about high-growth consumer startups, good UX, clean design, and most importantly working on projects that both challenge and inspire me.  I really love to contribute to projects and companies that I believe in.  If you feel like we may be a good fit to work together I'd love to hear from you!  Shoot me a note and I'll get back to you shortly.  Cheers </br><span class="thisgreen">griff at rockbottomcreativeagency dot com</span></p>

							<h2 style="text-align: center;">Location Based Chat</h2>
							<p><span class="image left phonemocks"><img src="images/localchat.png" alt="" /></span>No matter if you’re chasing snow in Japan, surf in Indo, or whitewater rapids in Wanaka, one thing is pretty consistent around the globe and that is the passionate groups of people in these action sports communities.  These people exist everywhere, but sometimes it’s really difficult to connect with like-minded people.  You can go to the local board shop, or maybe look on some obscure website, but there is no great way to connect with action sports enthusiasts in your area.  As my good mate said when he recently moved to Seattle and was looking for mountain biking buddies, “I just ended up going to the parking lot at the trailhead and waited for another group to arrive.”  Bummer - what a crap shoot, but we’ve all been there plenty of times.  This is where I think goFlow could thrive as an absolute necessity for all action sports athletes.  Just like other location based apps (a la Tinder), goFlow could connect you with other people who enjoy the same sports as you do in your area.  You could select your sport, select a distance, and get access to connect with others in a group message or 1-to-1.  This could be used to find new riding buddies, discuss local events/conditions, promote local riding clubs, and more.  As Reddit has shown, nothing is stronger than communities of people connected by a common love for something, and I think this would definitely be a great tool for action sports communities.  So this would take inspiration from the passionate communities of Reddit and the chat aspects of Slack, combined with the local focus of Tinder, and all based around your favorite action sports.  goFlow could be the number one source for connecting passionate action sports communities around the globe.</p>

						<h2 style="text-align: center;">Local Events</h2>
							<p><span class="image right phonemocks"><img src="images/localevents.png" alt="" /></span>Piggybacking on the concept of bringing together action sports communities, I would love to see a new tab added to the bottom nav for ‘events’.  There is no better way to get involved and meet people than attending fun events centered around the sports you love.  These events could bring together local communities for things like group rides, beach clean up days, gear swaps, local safety classes, product demos, film premiers, fundraisers, and more.  This would be a great community building feature both when you’re at home or when on the road exploring new places around the world.  In addition to providing users with a cool feature, this could also be a great source of revenue to offer sponsored posts.  For example, a surf shop could post about their ‘end of year’ sale to all surfers within 30 miles.  This would be an incredibly targeted user base that brands and businesses are very keen to get in front of in an authentic way.  Everyone from automobile and board companies to airlines and film companies would be interested to utilize these hyper-targeted local ads so this could be a great revenue source to explore.</p>

							<h2 style="text-align: center;">Local Experts / Guides</h2>
							<p><span class="image left phonemocks"><img src="images/localexperts.png" alt="" /></span>I think it’s really smart to introduce the new “local experts” feature and the direction that y’all seem to be going.  Obviously I don’t have access to the data but I would be really interested to see the early data from the beta.  One of the issues that I know businesses with similar models (like CoachUp) encountered was a lack of repeat bookings through the app.  It seems that once an expert and customer are paired they just facilitate future meetings outside of the app, saving themselves money and cutting out the app’s percentage of revenue.  Another alarming thing that came up is that of the 33 people I spoke to only 21% said they would consider booking an action sports “expert” for themselves or a child.  Conversely, 88% said they would consider booking a “guide” at their local spot or on the road.  I’m not sure if people were just averse to the term local expert or what, but it seems that many people would be more open to booking “guides” and people may be more interested in doing the “guiding” as well (I guess when people see “expert” they immediately think coach).  An easy fix here is just to add icons that allow locals to show whether they are offering guiding services, lessons, or both.  This would be a great thing to run a series of a/b tests on and I’d be very interested in seeing that data.</p>
